# Blinkit-Delivery-App-Analysis

1. Project Title
Blinkit Delivery App Analysis
A dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard built to explore Blinkit‚Äôs quick-commerce operations‚Äîfocusing on delivery performance, order trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency of Blinkit‚Äôs grocery delivery app.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Blinkit Delivery App Analysis dashboard is a visual Power BI report designed to help stakeholders monitor and understand Blinkit‚Äôs delivery app metrics, such as speed, order volume, regional performance, and revenue streams. It exists to enable data-driven decisions for improving delivery times, customer satisfaction, and profitability.

3. Tech Stack

List of technologies used to build the Blinkit dashboard:

üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì primary platform for building the report.

üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì for cleaning, shaping, and transforming data (orders, delivery logs, customer feedback, etc.).

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì for calculated measures like average delivery time, late delivery rate, revenue per order, etc.

üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì establishing relationships among tables such as Orders, Deliveries, Dark Stores, Customers, Delivery Partners, Products.

üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development; exported visuals (.png, .jpeg) or Power BI service dashboards for sharing.

4. Data Source

More info on where the data comes from and how it‚Äôs structured:

Source: Blinkit‚Äôs internal operational databases (orders, deliveries), partner/vendor systems, app usage logs, and customer feedback data.

Data Structure: Multiple tables such as:
‚Ä¢ Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_time, delivery_time, order_value, city/area)
‚Ä¢ Delivery Partners (partner_id, region, performance metrics)
‚Ä¢ Dark Stores Inventory / Location (store_id, stock levels, city/zone)
‚Ä¢ Customer Feedback / Ratings (order_id, rating, comments)
‚Ä¢ Costs & Fees (delivery fees, commissions, markup)

Granularity: Ideally minute‚Äêlevel timestamps for orders & deliveries; location granularity (city ‚Üí zone ‚Üí pincode); daily/weekly/monthly aggregations for trends.

5. Features / Highlights

Business Problem
Blinkit promises ultra-fast deliveries (10-25 mins) but faces challenges in maintaining consistent delivery times, managing costs, ensuring high customer satisfaction, and optimizing dark store and delivery partner efficiency. Decision-makers need insights across multiple dimensions to identify bottlenecks and improvement areas.

Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive visual tool that:
‚Ä¢ Enables monitoring of delivery performance across geographies and time.
‚Ä¢ Helps compare order volume, value, and customer satisfaction by region, time of day, product category.
‚Ä¢ Identifies inefficiencies in operations (delivery delays, late deliveries, partner underperformance).
‚Ä¢ Assesses revenue and cost drivers (commissions, delivery fees, product markups) to support profitability.

Business Impact & Insights
‚Ä¢ Operational Efficiency: Identify zones or times of day where delivery delays are high to re-allocate resources or adjust staffing/dark store locations.
